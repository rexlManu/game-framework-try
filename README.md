# game framework

That was my unsuccessful try to make a game framework for minigames.

I realised that it takes way too much time to create such a thing. Also many things get too complex and I actually need
to design first the whole concept and not just start it. But I would like to start it again in the future with a more a
plan but solong I will release it and maby somebody it could be helpful. Things like the own schematic system, async
block placement or anything else.

PS: Ignore that below me
